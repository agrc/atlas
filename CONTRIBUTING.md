# How to contribute to atlas.utah.gov

The `dev` branch is published to [atlas.dev.utah.gov](https://atlas.dev.utah.gov) and the `main` branch is published to [atlas.utah.gov](https://atlas.utah.gov).

All code should be developed on feature branches and pull requests should be made to `dev`.

[release-composite-action](https://github.com/agrc/release-composite-action) is used to create release pull requests automatically each time commits are merged to `dev` (prerelease) or `main` (prod releases).

All commit messages should be written using the [Angular flavor](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines) of [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

See our [release action](https://github.com/agrc/release-composite-action/blob/main/action.yml) for our accepted scopes.
